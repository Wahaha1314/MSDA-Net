## The official complete code for paper "Multi-Scale Direction-Aware Network for Infrared Small Target Detection" [[Paper/arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02037)]

1. This code integrates a series of infrared small target detection networks we built: **MLCL-Net** [[paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.infrared.2022.104107)],
**ALCL-Net** [[paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9785618)], **GGL-Net** [[paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10230271)]
and **MSDA-Net** [[Paper/arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02037)]. For details, please see the "model" folder.    

2. It is worth mentioning that **our solution based on MSDA-Net** won ***the first prize*** in **the PRCV2024 Wide-area Infrared Small Target Detection Challenge**
